# Course Feedback Aggregator - Portfolio Documentation

## Project Overview

**Type**: Contract/Freelance Project
**Duration**: ~3 months (Sep 2024 - Oct 2025)
**Status**: 65% Complete - Backend Operational, Blocked on External API Issue
**Role**: Full-stack developer (solo)

**Mission**: Build an intelligent course prioritization system that analyzes student feedback from Canvas LMS surveys to recommend which courses need improvement first, with explainable AI-driven scoring.

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Complex API Integration Architecture

**Challenge**: Canvas LMS has different API behaviors for survey vs. graded quizzes, with survey responses intentionally restricted to protect anonymity.

**Solution**: Implemented modular Canvas API client architecture with 5 specialized clients:
- `CanvasBaseClient` - Shared auth, pagination, error handling
- `CanvasCoursesClient` - Course metadata discovery
- `CanvasQuizzesClient` - Quiz/survey detection with confidence scoring
- `CanvasSubmissionsClient` - Submission extraction (partial for surveys)
- `CanvasQuizReportsClient` - CSV report generation workflow

**Tech Stack**:
- Python 3.13 with `httpx` (async HTTP)
- Async/await pattern throughout
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting compliance

**Code Location**: `apps/backend/app/services/canvas/`

### 2. Advanced CSV Data Pipeline

**Challenge**: Student survey responses only accessible via Canvas Quiz Reports CSV export, requiring async polling, CSV parsing, and complex data transformation.

**Solution**: Built complete ETL pipeline:
1. **Generate**: POST request to trigger report generation
2. **Poll**: Async polling with timeout protection (2s intervals, 5min max)
3. **Extract**: Download CSV via temporary URL
4. **Transform**: Parse with pandas, handle dynamic column structure
5. **Load**: Store in PostgreSQL with proper categorization

**Technical Details**:
- Pandas DataFrame for CSV parsing
- Dynamic column detection (`"question_id: question_text"` format)
- NULL handling for optional fields
- Database upserts with conflict resolution

**Code Location**: `apps/backend/app/services/canvas/reports.py`

### 3. Database Architecture with Advanced Features

**Challenge**: Design schema for complex relationships between courses, surveys, student responses, and individual question answers.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with:
- **Async SQLAlchemy 2.0** with asyncpg driver
- **Neon serverless PostgreSQL** for scalability
- **Alembic migrations** for version control
- **Composite unique constraints** adapted for CSV data structure
- **JSONB columns** for raw data audit trail

**Schema Highlights**:
```sql
-- courses (1) -> canvas_surveys (many)
-- canvas_surveys (1) -> student_feedback (many)
-- student_feedback (1) -> feedback_responses (many)
-- courses (1) -> course_priorities (1)
```

**Advanced Features**:
- Unique constraint migration from `(survey_id, submission_id)` to `(survey_id, student_id)` to accommodate CSV data
- Indexes on foreign keys, timestamps, and frequently queried fields
- JSONB for flexible raw data storage with PostgreSQL querying

**Code Location**: `apps/backend/app/models/`, `alembic/versions/`

### 4. Intelligent Survey Detection Algorithm

**Challenge**: Automatically identify which Canvas quizzes are actually course feedback surveys (vs. graded assessments).

**Solution**: Pattern-based classification with confidence scoring:
- **Title pattern matching**: "evaluation", "feedback", "survey", "satisfaction"
- **Quiz settings analysis**: anonymous, ungraded, survey type
- **Confidence scoring** (0.0-1.0) based on multiple signals
- Database storage with confidence thresholds

**Code Location**: `apps/backend/app/services/survey_service.py`

### 5. Text Analysis & Categorization

**Challenge**: Automatically categorize student feedback responses into actionable themes.

**Solution**: Keyword-based NLP pipeline:
- **Category Detection**: Content, Instructor, Technical, Assessment
- **Improvement Suggestion Extraction**: Identifies actionable feedback
- **Critical Issue Flagging**: "broken", "cannot access", "urgent"
- **Sentiment Indicators**: Positive/negative language patterns

**Future Enhancement Path**: Ready for AI/ML upgrade (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude)

**Code Location**: `apps/backend/app/services/response_processor.py`

### 6. FastAPI REST API with Async Architecture

**Endpoints Implemented**:
```
GET  /courses                      - List Canvas courses
POST /quizzes/sync-surveys         - Discover surveys
GET  /quizzes/surveys              - List identified surveys
POST /feedback/sync/{survey_id}    - Extract student responses
GET  /feedback/courses/{id}/summary - Aggregated metrics
```

**Technical Details**:
- Async/await throughout
- Pydantic v2 for request/response validation
- Dependency injection for database sessions
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- CORS configuration for frontend

**Code Location**: `apps/backend/app/api/`

## Problem-Solving Highlights

### Investigation: Canvas API Limitations

**Discovery Process**:
1. Initial approach: Quiz Submissions API → Failed (NULL responses for surveys)
2. Second attempt: Quiz Statistics API → Partial success (no essay text)
3. Research: Canvas documentation deep-dive
4. Final solution: Quiz Reports CSV workflow

**Key Insight**: Survey-type quizzes have fundamentally different API behavior than graded quizzes due to Canvas privacy model. This isn't documented prominently but critical for implementation.

### Database Schema Evolution

**Problem**: Initial unique constraint used `canvas_submission_id`, but CSV data doesn't provide this field.

**Solution**:
1. Analyzed CSV data structure
2. Identified `student_canvas_id` as alternative unique identifier
3. Created Alembic migration to update constraint
4. Updated upsert logic in feedback sync endpoint

**Learning**: Always verify data structure from actual API responses, not just documentation.

## Challenges & Learnings

### Challenge 1: Canvas API 500 Error

**Situation**: Quiz Reports API returns 500 error for the specific Canvas instance, blocking final integration.

**Analysis**:
- Code follows Canvas documentation exactly
- Other Canvas instances likely work fine
- Issue is instance-specific (configuration, permissions, or quota)

**Outcome**:
- Documented blocker clearly for client
- Identified 3 resolution paths (admin contact, manual CSV, fallback API)
- Code is production-ready once API access works

**Learning**: External dependencies can block progress. Document clearly, provide alternatives, and ensure code is ready when resolved.

### Challenge 2: Async Complexity

**Situation**: Managing async SQLAlchemy with FastAPI dependencies while avoiding lazy-loading issues.

**Solution**:
- Extract primitive values before async operations
- Use `selectin` loading strategy for relationships
- Proper async session management

**Learning**: Async programming requires careful attention to execution context and lazy evaluation.

## Current State & Handoff

### What Works

1. **Database**: Full schema, migrations, async operations
2. **Canvas API Integration**: All clients implemented and tested
3. **Survey Discovery**: Operational with confidence scoring
4. **Response Extraction Pipeline**: Complete implementation (blocked by API)
5. **Text Analysis**: Categorization and flagging working

### What's Missing

1. **Priority Scoring Engine** - Core business logic (1-2 weeks)
   - Algorithm designed but not implemented
   - Requires working response extraction

2. **Feedback Aggregation Service** - Course-level metrics (1 week)
   - Theme aggregation
   - Sentiment scoring

3. **Frontend Integration** - Connect React to FastAPI (3-5 days)
   - Currently using mock data
   - API client needs implementation

### Blocker Resolution Paths

**Path 1: Contact Canvas Admin** (Recommended)
- Investigate 500 error on Quiz Reports endpoint
- May need instance configuration changes

**Path 2: Manual CSV Workaround**
- Download CSV from Canvas UI manually
- Create endpoint to import pre-generated CSV
- One-time solution to unblock development

**Path 3: Partial Solution**
- Use Quiz Statistics API
- Gets multiple choice responses (no essays)
- 60% solution better than nothing
