    "improvement_opportunities": "There was discussion about training, I wonder if there is something more specific, if a person doesn't meet requirements for a position, can this pers get more specified training to help them qualify. Maybe it's an area that in past was more gender bias.  Stem programs are great, I've volunteered for some. What I didn't notice was a way to follow up on the people who were genuinely interested.",

    "improvement_opportunities": "I've learned about different personality assessment tool, and how using them to set up a well rounded team can be an asset to a project or a team. It might be nice to take a look at some of these tools, as they do deal with emotions. There are good studies on them helping in a company, with bias. One that stands out is BANK.",
