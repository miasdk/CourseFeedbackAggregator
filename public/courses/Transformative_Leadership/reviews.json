    "improvement_opportunities": "This module was very video heavy.  The lectures were lengthy to maintain adult learner attention.  They bogged down with the abundance of information on each leader.  The facilitator's points were sometimes lost in the long biographies of the leaders he mentioned.  Perhaps breaking up the lectures into shorter chunks, and adding more interactive elements, would make the module more engaging.  Also, there was a bad link in Module 2, Section 13.  I have attached a screenshot of the error.",
