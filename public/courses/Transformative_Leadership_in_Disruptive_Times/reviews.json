    "improvement_opportunities": "If it fits with word count/time - I would try at the end to intentionally address the SWBAT for the module and its tie in to the next one so students track with the module outcomes/direction. A bit of spiral learning at the end ... nothing major at all. I never assume the audience is following my train of thought on why I am choosing to teach \"this\" vs \"that\". I continually circle back for connecting dots in data/choice of readings, etc.",

Excellent excellent - don't be afraid to call out the courage and bravery required to stand up - and face the times with their many issues!!",
    "improvement_opportunities": "With Nelson - I would simply call out intentionally what made him transformational (bullet points) AND what the disruption was... nothing overdone but again, I think we assume people know what he did that was so amazing and out of step with his time!!  He was so brave - he took on so many heavy decisions.... and he persevered. An easy bullet point or two would work....transformational leader because... etc.",
