    "improvement_opportunities": "The narrator is distracting. He just stood there and I found myself looking at his moustache too much of the time. I was watching him so much that I had to go back and review the video again. When I walked away and let the video play, I was able to focus on the content.  I don't think his physical appearance needs to be part of the video. His voice is great.",

    "improvement_opportunities": "- More up to date information: The chapter should be written in present tense. There are several places that it is written in future tense.  AI is used in most HR Article choice: https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-role-ai-human-resource-management This article is written in 2021. I would like to suggest to utilize articles within 1 or 2 years for an ever changing topic like AI. The article also had outdated information and several grammar mistakes. I would replace with a more credible source.  https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/applications/hcm/oracle-ai-in-hr-wp.pdf This pdf is from 2019 and has statistics in it that probably changed drastically since then. I would suggest to find more up to date information on these great stats.  - Include Generative AI: In addition to Chat GPT , I would recommend to include Generative AI and its use within HR which is most recent and evolving more than the decade old Chat GPT.",
