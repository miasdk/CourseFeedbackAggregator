    "positive_comments": "All three lessons contained great information.  The first one on incorporating AI had some excellent examples of AI-powered platforms, providing examples of programs and how they can benefit employees.  The second one on Human-Machine Collaboration contained the critical consideration to reskill or upskill people whose current jobs are at risk from AI.  Definitely keep that information to make sure that leaders are aware of how to help their teams navigate AI changes.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "The third lesson on Resilience did not come across as strong as the first two lessons.  Two of the studies contradicted each other, with the Ernst & Young study concluding that \"AI makes them more efficient and frees up time\" while the JAMA Network Open study concluded that \"AI didn\u2019t shorten the amount of time they spent on the task.\"  Maybe acknowledging how different studies have opposing conclusions would help, with a comment that sometimes AI can reduce time spent on tasks while other times it may not reduce work time but will reduce mental fatigue and job burnout.",

    "positive_comments": "The first lesson on Reskilling and Upskilling is excellent.  Great advice on not trying to incorporate AI throughout the organization all at once but to choose where it will have the biggest impact.  The second lesson contained important information about the global workforce and how companies need to grow and change with technology or risk losing employees to other employers.  Also good information on how important ethical standards are in an AI environment.  The third lesson conclusion contained a good recap of the modules and content learned in the course.",

    "improvement_opportunities": "I think that asking in the discussion points for each module how the individual might use or employ the information in their own situation could make a stronger impact.  For Example Within module ____ we discussed the power and need of the ethical application of decisions using AI.  Describe a situation in our current position where ethic and AI can be applied to achieve better outcomes?",
