    "positive_comments": "\u2022 It is great that transcripts are offered up front in the module. This welcomes people who learn in different methods. \t\u2022 The module succeeds in highlighting why AI becomes biased and how that impacts women. I believe explaining the impact is important, but including how the issues begin allows the listener to ensure they stop the same trends from occurring in their leadership roles. \t\u2022 \"Transparency and Accountability Plan\" is a great worksheet. The assignment is a knowledge check and also causes the student to think about potential AI impacts at their organization. \t\u2022 This module is extremely important due to the majority of AI discussions focusing on the positive usefulness of the tool. However, this module emphasizes the potential negative impacts if the tool is not governed and adjusted. The module reinforces why this course is relevant and will become increasingly more relevant in the future. \t\u2022 The user interface uses appropriate colors, shapes, and animations to keep the student engaged in the subject.  Suggestion: (Ethical 8 of 8) Helpful Resources - This page could document the sources cited to provide the claims and supporting evidence used in development of the module.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "\u2022 (Ethical 1 of 8) Presentation: Ethical Implications of AI for Women Leaders - Around 2:36 mark in the video, there is a grunting background sound. It does not take away from the content of the video. However, it is something to note. \t\u2022 The article \"AI Regulation and Ethical Leadership in 2024\" from Medium.com makes claims without sources to support. I viewed the original article on medium.com and I did not observe any mention of sources. \t\u2022 (Ethical 3 of 8) Presentation: Gender Biases in AI Decision-Making Processes - The speaker mentions a study published in the journal \"Science,\" however, they do not mention the study name or provide the study name in text below. There is no way for the listener to validate the study or perhaps seek out the source to read the study for themselves.  (Ethical 4 of 8) Discussion: Gender Bias in AI and Its Impact on Women's Leadership - If the listener follows the YouTube link, they are bound to view toxic/negative comments against women or about the topic (Something to keep in mind). I read some of the comments for this video, there is a mix of positive and negative. I am not sure if the video could be downloaded and added to the module without a link to YouTube. This would allow the module to control this aspect.",

    "positive_comments": "This module covers a wide range of mentorship and sponsorship programs for women in AI. I appreciated the actionable insight to research successful mentorship programs and promote students to create their own opportunities in the  AI industry. This lesson keeps students engaged by highlighting successful programs that have helped create supportive environments where women can succeed in the AI space. By empowering women with the knowledge and resources they can actively advance their careers and contribute to the field of AI. I really enjoyed the last piece of the module, Creating Networks and Communities. As you said, it doesn't need to be complicated to create the community for women!",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Because there is so much emphasis on researching existing mentorship groups, I would suggest including a case study of one of these sponsorship programs so students can have a concrete example of a success story. I would also ensure that the mentorship groups include perspectives of women from different ethnicities, backgrounds, and career stages. The experiences of a high level officer vs a first year hire looks very different.  When discussing mentorship I believe it's also important to include allyship. Promoting allyship in supporting and championing women in AI and other spaces where women are underrepresented helps create a more inclusive environment. A section on Allyship would be beneficial in the last part of the module, adding to the community piece.",

    "positive_comments": "I enjoyed reading through this module because it includes hard facts about the challenges women face in the AI space. The module provides a comprehensive examination of gender disparities in education and research from the beginning stages of a women's journey, starting at a young age where young women are pitted against young men all the way up the job chain because of assumptions made about assumed gender norms. The real world examples and statistics adds relevance making the content more concrete. It also made me reflect on my journey as a woman in STEM, and the hardships I faced while trying to rise in a tech role. I also appreciated the strategies and initiatives organizations can do to address the gender disparities and promote inclusion. There is power in numbers!",
    "improvement_opportunities": "I would include a story that address the intersectionality of gender with other factors such as race and socioeconomic status to further investigate how these identities affect women's experiences in AI education and research. Perspectives from different geographic regions is also always interesting to explore due to differences in culture and work practices. I would include a success story of how an organization helped an individual rise in the AI space. In the last section about Retaining Women in AI Research Fields, it would be interesting to learn the number of turnover of women leaders. Are they being pushed out? Or are they not being hired in the first place?",

    "positive_comments": "1.  Helpful insights provided in the external links directly related to use of AI-driven tools, discussing the pros/cons of AI use, addressing worker anxiety around AI replacing certain functions, and encouraging women to get involved in this new field through educational opportunities.  2.   Discussion topics prompt evaluation of how AI can enhance or disrupt the status quo and how to embrace this change as we enter a new era of technological advancement.  3.  The section \"Utilizing AI technologies to enhance work-life balance\" was spot on and concise.  Each topic related back to AI to demonstrate the power of utilizing the tools.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "1.  The topic of the course is about how women leaders can navigate the world of AI, but I feel like this module in particular shares more about the inequalities felt by women leaders and making the movement to empowerment than how to actually navigate and/or utilize AI-driven tools to accomplish goals.  Some of the articles do directly address the 'how', but the course 'top 10' don't directly support the link topics.  For example, the section \"Promoting flexibility and well-being in female leadership roles\" provides a list with examples, but it doesn't address how AI can be used to assist in ensuring advocacy for flexibility in the workplace - how can the tools be leveraged to make a case for use of AI to solve the issues associated inflexibility in the workplace?  It's all good knowledge to have, but it feels like 'filler' for the course rather than making a direct connection to navigating AI (same for the last few noted under \"Strategies for managing workload and stress in AI-driven environments\").  2.  For the section(s) that discuss using AI for detection and mitigation of bias, it would be helpful to provide an example of what that looks like (perhaps another link?) so it can be properly addressed.  How can a woman leader present the issues and encourage HR to utilize the AI-driven tools that prove bias?  Or, is the message 'if you're in charge of HR, use the AI tools to see how well your company scores'?  3.  The last 2 external links regarding flexible work environments and the future of flexibility at work are good to know, but perhaps one link could be switched out to include how AI can be/will be embedded in the future to support the possibility of a flexible work environment.  Of course, there's the other side to consider where AI doesn't sleep, so the expectation becomes people working longer hours.  Perhaps there is middle-ground in split-time opportunities for people to engage in?  4.  In the article regarding upskilling/reskilling, there is opportunity here to expand upon opportunities, such as free resources, top-rated certification programs (perhaps there's one available in this school?), etc.  If students want to learn more, where do they find this information?  It is possible to course online does provide additional resources, but I can't tell from this section (it would be helpful to have a link in the module that takes you to a page in another window to learn more, or something along those lines).  Personally, I find it helpful to have resources at my fingertips as I'm navigating the course rather than waiting until the end of the course to see what's available/been provided.",
