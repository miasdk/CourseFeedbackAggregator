I understand that this module gives insight into the types of problems that could be solved by deploying AI, but it does not speak to what kind of IA could be used. For example, are we talking about NLP, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Generative IA, etc.?  Therefore, I am getting a sense of which project could be good for AI intervention, but no guidance on what type of IA could be used.",

This will allow for easier reference later.  In general, summary slides after each video will be useful. This will go hand-in-hand with the articles shared at the end of the module. I would have loved to see more examples of the challenges of theperiods as CRM evolved so I could connect it with the benefits of today to make my strategic arguments.  The course seems to be geared more towards B2C and commodity sales than B2B sales. Correct?",

In addition, it is argued that the evolution of CRM is useful and impactful; I would love to see a few metrics of how impactful CRM used to be and how it is today. Especially as we moved from more manual capturing to an automated environment. Strategically, it would be great to know the baseline we are working with today. i.e., what kind of strategic disadvantage will we have without looking at AI seriously?",
