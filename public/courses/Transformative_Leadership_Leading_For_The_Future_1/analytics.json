          "issue": "I brought up ethics and values in the first box of the Course Reviewer Worksheet because students should understand the difference between ethics and moral values. These are two separate things that the professional should distinguish and learn how to apply both in the workplace and throughout their life journey. The course did not define these differences sufficiently before moving on to transforming the professional's leadership traits. Moral values will differ from one person to the next. However, ethics concerns principles, laws, regulations, and social standards. Professionals who recognize the difference can better build a personal brand, which becomes how people know them as leaders because they are ethical (comply with rules and policies) and hold themselves accountable to their moral values. All professionals are leaders; each person should build personal branding and understand its impact on well-being. Creating your own \"yellow umbrella\" is essential. The example of Nelson Mandela was not the best for today's modern leaders. I recall reading about Nelson Mandela in the course four years ago. Updating the course curriculum with current real-world examples should be completed annually.",

Completing the behavioral assessment sets the stage for each student to consider the assessment outcome and which areas may be causing career setbacks. The professional can begin building a leadership framework to improve, self-regulate, and self-manage through soft skills development. Also, introducing the benefits of life coaching and providing a video lecture of a BetterUp coach providing real-world examples of creating a personal plan to achieve professional and personal life goals that impact each other.",
