Assignment 1: \u2022\tThe instructions say to discuss answers with fellow learners, but this is an assignment. Should it be a Discussion Question instead? Otherwise, where should they discuss their answers? Video 3: \u2022\tHas a glitch \u2013 it repeats two parts of the video. Video 4: \u2022\tThe description under this video is Video 3\u2019s description.  \u2022\tThe IBM Watson example concerns me. \u2022\tThe Humanyze example for ID Badges is another privacy issue.
