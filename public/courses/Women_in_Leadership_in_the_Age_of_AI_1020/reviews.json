    "positive_comments": "Just a comment about all of the modules -- I really like that the transcripts are available to download for easy note taking. I also like the video lecture edits, I think they're very clean and concise.   I enjoyed this module on Strategies for Advancing Women in AI Leadership. I like the flow from Module 3 speaking to the ethical considerations related to women leaders in AI. It is a clear flow from the gender biases to the transparency and accountability plans companies take to ensure equitable progress.  Then in Module 4 there are clear examples on how to develop women focused leadership skills.  This is supported through the networks and communities, which will be small in the beginning, but will grow over time. I think recognizing that this is still a growing field is important and hopefully it will not discourage the learners to back away from the space just because the community is small. I think it is interesting that on top of the stress, burnout, and isolation many women in leadership feel that in addition to juggling all of their tasks they also have to build their own community. Therefore having learners implement these ideas at their own companies may inspire others to do so. The statistic you included in Strategy 5/8, that women make up only 10.4% of leaders at Fortune 500 companies is eye opening. It makes it clear that these networks will be crucial for more women to be comfortable in this space.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "I think there needs to be a case study highlighting the successes of women mentors in the AI space. There could also be a resource page linking to groups that are already doing this. For example, Wai2GO is an educational program to raise awareness and empower women for action in the field of AI. Women in AI Ethics powered by Lighthouse 3 has global initiatives to support and guide women and non-binary people focused using mentorship. The Strategy 2/8 Discussion to Cultivate Inclusive Leadership seems a bit out of place and may do better in Module 5 - Fostering Women's Leadership in Cultivating Inclusive Teams.",

    "positive_comments": "I enjoyed this Module as a wrap up to the entire course. I especially enjoyed the Presentation on the Impact of AI Advancements on Women's Leadership Opportunities. I liked the discussion questions that came after this presentation, specifically 1. Have you encountered any challenges or roadblocks in promoting gender diversity within your organization's leadership. At my company, I tried to promote a Day in the Life series for teams to learn about others' day to day duties, and our HR person did not see the value. She told leadership that she thought it was a waste of time and would not be impactful. However, when I suggested the idea to my peers, they were all excited about sharing their projects and workflows. Despite HR pushing back, my teammates encouraged me to do the series and everyone who presented gained respect from others at the company. It is unfortunate when you don't have support from your own community so it's important to keep trying if you can see the value.  I bet a lot of women have experienced this, and having the last question 3. What advice would you give... based on your own experiences... will give  a lot of genuine insight to the rest of the learners.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Something that I feel is missing from the course is self advocation. There's a lot of great ideas on how to reach out, find community, be inclusive, but one of the biggest challenges I can foresee is imposter syndrome. Especially since we've established that the field is small (but growing) it can be intimidating to add ideas or speak on behalf of personal experiences. Confidence and self advocacy is rarely taught and I feel it would be beneficial to have a presentation about this somewhere in the course. https://ai.emory.edu/articles/self-advocacy-and-resiliency.html --> here is a good article about self advocacy and resiliency for women in leadership roles.",
