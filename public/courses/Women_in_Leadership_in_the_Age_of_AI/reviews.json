    "improvement_opportunities": "Other actions that we could highlight: invest in targeted upskilling and career pathways, prioritize reskilling programs for roles most at risk of automation and ensure these programs are accessible to women, including flexible formats and childcare support, create career mobility pathways into growth roles (e.g., digital operations, AI oversight, customer experience management) that align with women's existing skills. One important action is to redesign work to retain Human Value, such as redefine job content to emphasize uniquely human contributions\u2014e.g., empathy, judgment, interpersonal communication\u2014which are often strengths in female-majority roles, and leverage AI to augment, not replace, human work\u2014focusing on relieving repetitive tasks rather than eliminating roles entirely. Embed Gender Equity in AI Governance and DEI Strategies through ensuring AI risk management frameworks include gender bias and exclusion risks, aligning AI strategy with corporate ESG and DEI commitments, showing public accountability for gender-equitable outcomes, advocating for responsible tech procurement, selecting AI vendors whose models are tested for bias and support fair labor outcomes. Measure, Report, and Improve through tracking and reporting on gender impacts of AI implementation (e.g., participation in training, job displacement, promotion), using diversity scorecards linked to incentives for leaders to drive accountability, adapting strategy based on outcomes\u2014AI governance must be iterative and inclusive.",

    "improvement_opportunities": "Although the 3 topics are very important, they are not alone to improve gender hiring and fostering women in leadership. Research made in Brazil about Women in Leadership by Talenses Group and Insper University with more than 200 organizations (including multinationals from USA) showed that they are not enough to consolidate the gender diversity in the highest levels of organizations. It's important to observe that best practices show that only when Companies integrate ESG strategy, with public commitments, and action plans, we will see the highest levels of female participation at all hierarchical roles. Also, especially in STEM jobs, companies are competing with each other to get the same females in the same industries, creating a finite pipeline and not giving opportunities to new professionals. One of the ideas discussed in a discussion group at Insper University was to find professionals from different industries and also train not STEM in certain jobs that could be performed by them.",

Female leaders must pay attention in how other females in their teams can be impacted by AI in female dominated roles, acknowledging and assessing the impact to have a complete strategy on how to overcome this challenge and action promptly to not let these groups of female workers be afraid to learn new skills and to use the AI tools for their benefit. They can use the tools Use tools like the Partnership on AI's Shared Prosperity Guidelines or the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s 2024 AI principles to guide assessments. Suggestions to engage the women in our teams:  Include women in cross-functional AI governance groups. Conduct worker voice forums or focus groups specifically with female employees in high-risk roles to understand concerns and co-develop solutions. Promote human-centered design that takes into account lived experiences and job realities of women.",

    "rating": 4,
    "positive_comments": "One of the aspects I truly appreciated in Module 1 was the use of historical references to frame the ongoing challenges and opportunities for women in leadership. The examples that resonated most with me were those tied directly to technological development, particularly Ada Lovelace and the early contributions to computer science. These stories honored women's legacy in innovation and grounded the topic in real, often overlooked history.  I also found the video discussing AI-driven hiring practices and gender inequities incredibly compelling. It illustrated how algorithms trained on biased historical data can perpetuate exclusion, especially in traditionally male-dominated fields like tech, in an eye-opening and highly relevant way. It made me reflect on the invisible systems shaping women's access to leadership roles today.  These themes feel timely and important, and I\u2019d love to see them developed further as we progress through the program.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "While I found Module 1 informative and well-structured, there are a couple of areas where the content could be strengthened even further.  First, the opening visual of women in tech didn\u2019t quite match the tone or energy of the following content. Given the boldness and innovation inherent in AI and tech leadership today, a more dynamic or inspirational image could better reflect the modern reality and potential of women leading in this space. A powerful visual can help set the stage for what\u2019s to come and energize the learner experience.  Second, in the segment that discusses Google\u2019s Women Founders Accelerator, the funding figure shared ($73.46 million) is compelling, but would have a greater impact with a specific timeframe, such as \u201csince 2020\u201d or \u201cas of 2024.\u201d Adding a point of comparison to overall VC (venture capital) spending on startups could also help contextualize how small that number is relative to industry norms. This would strengthen the message and help learners understand both the progress and the persisting systemic inequities.  These adjustments would enhance clarity and impact and help ground the module\u2019s key points in the current, fast-evolving reality of women in AI leadership.",

    "module_name": "Module 2",
    "rating": 4,
    "positive_comments": "One of the most valuable takeaways from Module 2 was the explanation of the 360-degree feedback process. I appreciated how the module emphasized its role in uncovering hidden biases and identifying behavioral patterns that may be limiting inclusion or advancement. It was a helpful reminder that developing inclusive leadership isn\u2019t just about checking boxes; it requires intentional, structured reflection from multiple perspectives. I remember taking and administering the survey, and it was helpful to our organization.   Using 360 feedback as a tool for growth, rather than judgment, helps create more self-aware leaders and ensures that promotion decisions are informed by a broader, more balanced view of someone\u2019s capabilities.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Module 2 offered valuable insights, especially around tools like 360 feedback and bias recognition. However, there\u2019s a strong opportunity to make the content more robust and relevant.  First, several stats on women\u2019s leadership and representation seem to be from as far back as 2016. This topic has evolved rapidly, and incorporating updated figures would better reflect today\u2019s landscape. For example:  As of 2024, women hold just 10.4% of Fortune 500 CEO roles (Fortune).  Women make up 30% of board seats at Russell 3000 companies, yet their presence in executive leadership is declining (FT, 2024).  Black women hold only 1.4% of C-suite positions, despite being 7.4% of the U.S. population (LeanIn & McKinsey, Women in the Workplace 2023).  Second, including first-hand stories from women in tech could deepen the learning experience. Personal reflections, especially from those navigating intersectional challenges, would ground the module in lived experience and help connect theory to real-world leadership barriers and breakthroughs.  Adding these elements would increase both the credibility and impact of the module in my opinion.",

The reason I say this is because the understanding of the decision-making process can be well gathered first and it would be easier to understand the ethical implications then. Also, I'd add business implications besides ethical implications too. It would bring additional impact depending on the background of the students and would make a stronger case to drive changes.",

In my own experience, I've seen some reduction in STEM at universities, but they are not data proved, only perception.",

    "positive_comments": "Navigating Gender Diversity Gaps in AI Research -- I appreciated that this module focused on actionable strategies to foster more inclusivity for women within the AI field. It has been proven that leadership positions, access to opportunities, and training data is skewed that limits accuracy for women and POC. Therefore there must be measurable processes in place to incorporate more females along the pipeline, from leadership to management to building the AI. Implementing education and outreach programs would greatly incorporate more women into the space by simply providing more access.  I really enjoyed the case study options provided in this module, as it is almost normalized to have better data for men than women because of the assumption females are not as interested in this technology. The resulting AI technologies result in noninclusive or equitable experiences for women in all kinds of spaces where they are necessary, such as healthcare or resource allocation.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "When discussing gender diversity gaps it is important to consider global perspectives. Due to cultural differences or how the AI work is viewed and used, gender representation may look different. There are cultural and institutional factors influencing gender representation in AI research worldwide and the differences could result in AI technology very differently due to different training data.  A way to gain diverse perspectives if this course is open globally is to have the students interact with each other via discussion board, where the assignment is to answer a prompt and also respond to one of their peers. Or, we could add a case study about how AI is being developed around the globe with gender diversity in mind. A quick search tells me that women make up only 22% of AI professionals globally. Their viewpoints and ideas may be trumped or not taken seriously, which ultimately affects the AI product.",

    "positive_comments": "Inspiring Emotional Intelligence -- I believe this is the most important module in the course. Artificial intelligence is also unnatural, structured, and hollow. You can prompt the AI with an emotion or a tone, but you cannot get the true feeling behind the words or product. I like the call for action in this module as well, but more related to the self rather than the structure, calling for emotional regulation, resilience building, and emulating confidence for the ones leading the discussion. There is obvious significance for female leaders. The way they manage themselves is often reflected in the way they manage their teams. I liked this line: \"By demonstrating emotional authenticity, empathy, and integrity, female leaders can foster environments of psychological safety and mutual respect, where individuals feel valued and empowered to contribute their best.\" Engaging in meaningful and impactful interactions can drive positive outcomes and cultivate a great team environment.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "I would suggest the same discussion requirements as suggested for the previous module review^. Whenever there is a discussion board, have two posts mandatory, one to write an original response to a prompt and another to write a thoughtful response to a peer. There is also room to incorporate general DEI initiatives targeted to other minority groups which would benefit not only the women in leadership but their team as well. Because this module is also more personal than the other modules based on AI, I would suggest a reflection activity for students to self assess their emotional intelligence and look for opportunities to improve. Challenge the students to change one thing at the beginning of the module, write a self assessment, complete the rest of the modules, and revisit the self assessment. At the end of the day AI is built by people, and people leaders must be self aware to lead positively in this space.",
