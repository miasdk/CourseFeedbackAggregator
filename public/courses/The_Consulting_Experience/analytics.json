There are references to attending workshops with peers, assigning roles within your team, and weekly meetings with a mentor.  It appears the program is a collaborative effort and not an independent, asynchronous course.  Whichever format is planned, it needs to be clearly stated to set student expectations of whether they will be working with a team and mentor, or working independently.",
