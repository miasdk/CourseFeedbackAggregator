    "positive_comments": "1.  Great information for encouraging women to become mentors and to be the example of work-life balance.  Women often believe they need to be superwomen, doing all the things and making it all look effortless.  Reality is women take on more than their fair share of tasks, burdens, caretaking, and the like, then become frustrated, stressed, and burned out.    2.  Setting boundaries is always good advice, not just for women.    3.  Transforming work culture to support work-life balance is often difficult to achieve, especially if the environment is toxic.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "1.  In the AI 1.0 course, there's a section added in the beginning encouraging participants to connect with other organizations - this would also be beneficial to add to the AI2.0 course.    2.  Although I believe women should uplift others through example and/or mentoring, I'm not certain what this module has to do with AI.  Is there a way to include aspects of what AI can offer for women seeking work-life balance and being available to mentor others?  In the course AI 2.0, there is good information on how AI may impact work-life balance (positive/negative) and provides additional information on connecting and collaborating using AI-driven tools for mentorship.  Perhaps this module can provide examples, resources, etc. for how to utilize AI-driven tools to make those connections, apply time-management, promote learning and mentoring, etc.  If this information is located elsewhere in the course, perhaps indicate the reason for providing this background and explain how it ties into the overall course objectives.  3.  Supporting external links provide information about the 'what' and the 'why' identifying inequalities faced by women, but there isn't a lot of discussion on the 'how' to fix it, nor addressing additional bias concerning race, gender identity, disability, or nationality.  When we discuss women in leadership, the default tends to be the image of 'educated white American' women, but the 'inclusion' portion promoting DEI awareness should be reflective of all underserved populations.  In this instance, how can AI-driven tools be applied to help close the gap for everyone?  How can an educational platform such as this assist women in opening up topics in the workplace and gaining traction on changes/improvements to policy?  Is this something AI-driven tools can assist with, such as reducing time in conducting good research, returning results on how to best present statistics and global knowledge on a topic, etc.?",

    "positive_comments": "-  Video 1: The video describes what the impact is and why the impact matters. (Very important to explain why. This section explains efficiently)  - The module guides the student to confirm that some major challenges share the same root causes and symptoms (Videos 1 and 2).  - The module then provides guidance regarding how to resolve the root causes (Video 3).  - The module does not simply highlight challenges, it also provides solutions to resolve challenges.  - The presented challenges are precise and keep the audience engaged.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "-  Video 1: The section discussing women of color underrepresentation would benefit from a statistic. Are there any studies that provide a quantitative representation of gender and/or ethnicity in AI roles? For example, the case study, \"The Economist\u2019s glass-ceiling index\" provides stats for women. Is there a similar study specifically for women of color in AI roles?  - An impactful and engaging addition to this module would be including a discussion point focused on advocating for policy change. Policy change is one of the largest impacts an individual can make. The current discussion points focus on what changes need to be made. However, there could be a discussion point regarding how to effectively introduce and implement a policy change as a woman. Students could discuss policies they have changed or have witnessed changed. They could also discuss policies they would like to see change and how that impacts the future vision for women entering the workforce. (This would require that students have to respond to at least one post).  - I assume that the case study, \"The Economist\u2019s glass-ceiling index\" will be made available. Currently, you have to register or log in to view the article.  - The module could delve into the emerging role of the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) in organizations. This is a crucial topic that needs our attention due to a combined challenge for women in AI and women in leadership roles. This could be included in another module, whichever is appropriate.",

    "positive_comments": "- The module has an efficient flow of content that increases the ease of learning.  - \"Economic shocks are wiping out progress on gender equality: Global Gender Gap Report 2023\" is a great article with multiple ways to learn and engage (text, stats, graphs, attention-grabbing section headers).  - Content filled articles/case studies in this module.  - The modules build on each other and also refer back to lessons learned in previous modules. Reoccurring themes include the need for policy change and mentorship.  - Video 2 provides precise content on how to resolve challenges with inclusivity.  - Part of my Master's Thesis focused on some elements of cultural intelligence. It was an impactful conclusion from my studies. I am very glad to see that cultural intelligence is being emphasized to current and future leaders. It is extremely impactful.  - The module emphasizes a multifaceted approach is needed to resolve diversity challenges.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "- Video 1: In the \"Transparent Promotion Processes\" section, the author should mention documented meetings to evaluate employee performance bi-quarterly or quarterly (in comparison to an annual basis). This decreases the chances of surprise feedback during the promotion conversation, which is usually completed during annual reviews. Also, there is more guidance throughout the year that leads to awareness of the qualifications and progress required for a promotion.  - Video 1: In the \"Work-Life Balance Initiatives\" section, adding that women should be aware of federal and/or local laws regarding work-life balance (such as parental leave). This is a powerful tool when implementing policy changes within the organization.  - Video 2: In the \"Creating Safe Spaces\" section, while companies may have a zero-tolerance policy, it is not always safe to report. Therefore, it is also important to create a safe way to report when the safe space has been compromised.",
