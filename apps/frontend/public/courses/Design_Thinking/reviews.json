    "improvement_opportunities": "I think some exercises (other than discussion) earlier in the course might be useful.  Maybe something like giving a situation and asking some questions - for example 'Your team is designing a learning toy for 3-4 year olds' and asking things like who they'd want to work with, how they'd approach the discovery phase, etc.  Nothing too big, something well broken down, but a chance to actually play with a situation.",
