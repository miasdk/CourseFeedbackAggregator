    "improvement_opportunities": "I think there are a few opportunities here. One would be to have another part about reporting and go into them a little deeper with more specific information about how they differ. The second would be to have the readings be longer. I personally feel like the readings are a really valuable aspect of the course and one that provides a lot of value. I think it's an opportunity to really engage the course taker and provide details that are hard to include with the speakers. Lastly, there's another part about Supply Chains here. I think it would be beneficial to have all of them together in one Module rather than spaced out within a few.",

    "improvement_opportunities": "I do have similar feedback here in that the readings are pretty short. I would also like to see more summary information that ties the modules together. Executives like to see how all the items are related in a more holistic nature. You could touch on how companies that are leading in ESG also lead in profitability and how the former brings in more consumers and customers. The other opportunity is that the last video says you've reached the end of the course and then there are readings after. That video should really be the last thing in my opinion.",

The Triple Bottom Line and CSR. This is important as a framework for executives to comprehend and hopefully move more organizations from just profit-seeking entities.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Although talked about a little in the Innovations Shaping a Greener Future, I think their should be more about EV's. Automotive contributes a lot to climate change and, as an industry, has lots of opportunities to discuss in terms of sustainability. Mining, supply chain and logistics, manufacturing, data and emissions. I think EVs should have their own reading because they encompass every aspect of business from the ground to the consumer.",

I think it provides a good foundation for understanding important topics within sustainability, especially the part with the EPA, assuming the course is mostly taken by US citizens. It also looks at a wider range of information within sustainability.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Compared to the other modules, the readings are all rather short, especially the Sectoral Solution to Climate Change, which is really only one page. That topic, raising the global temperature by 1.5 degrees and its effects, is really important. This should be discussed in more detail because I think many US citizens don't understand what this really means and how it will affect them both personally or how it may affect their business, supply chain, logistics, and many other things. I think the reading here should be an 8-9 page article.",

    "improvement_opportunities": "My feedback here is the individual sections are out of order. For example, The Role of AI in Logistics and Supply Chain is before The History and Evolution of AI. The former should be towards the end. After The History should be The Evolution of AI From Inception to Present. This could also be combined with the The History because they are both basically the same topic. I would have Decoding the next section followed by Key Principles, Strategic Planning, Evalutating AI solutions, The last the Role of AI in Logistics.",
