    "improvement_opportunities": "Level setting of what AI is and is not would have been good. The first article makes some assumptions that the learner knows some basics and many do not in this space. Articles are a bit dated for an area that is changing so rapidly.  The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Modern HR video (intro 1 of 11) It starts from the perspective that people know what these things are (large language model, IBMs Watson, etc) and many may not.   Article in 2/11 is from 2021 (AnalysticsSteps.com). AI has changed so much and although the article isn\u2019t wrong, an article dated that old may not have as much credibility as it could with something more recent. Article from Business News Daily, Ways AI is Changing HR Departments was a good article and reinforced a lot of key points. The discussion in 4/11 section could be just as effective without needing a second article.   In the videos, the narrator\u2019s alternative pronunciation of words is distracting. I wasn\u2019t sure at first if it was due to an accent but I do not think so. I also was asking my self if the narrator is an AI bot - that would be clever if he is.  Nit-picky of me but that\u2019s a lot of exclamation points in the first paragraph of the linked instructions for Your Canvas Assignments (4 including the title) on how to download and submit assignments. \ufffc  The text in the 4/11 Discussion prompt has a sentence in there that I\u2019m not sure is worded right. The last sentence, \u201cHowever, resistance to AI can hinder efficiency, support remote workers, talent acquisition, productivity, and organizational competitiveness\u2019 seems to be making a couple different points that don\u2019t all fall under resistance to AI. Are there verbs missing for talent acquisition, productivity, etc?  Oracle\u2019s AI in Human Resources article is good but also very dated as its from 2018. This article may be better as a part of an earlier section as it sets up what is AI vs Machine Learning vs Digital Assistants. The older article wouldn\u2019t feel as dated if used to set up a bit of foundation around \u2018what is AI\u2019.",

The activity of mapping out your org\u2019s recruitment process is great and allows the learner to take a step back and think about the process at their own org which I\u2019m sure many (outside of recruitment) have not done.   The assignment 1 in section 5/12 - the Value Framework is a good assignment that gets folks thinking about their process and where they can apply AI.   I love the real world examples shares from Unilever and Mya, Jacque Reed, etc, showing something from their platform would make it even better.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "The introduction of different AI tools into the recruitment process seems to be missing the risks that come with it (HR, Legal, bias, loss of personal touch). I think some of that would come out in discussion but pointing it out as it stood out to me as missing.  Addressing the risks and what risks to be mindful of when exploring AI for something as legally protecting as hiring should be mentioned more.",
