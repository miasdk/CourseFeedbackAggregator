    "positive_comments": "I thought this module was well organized and an important topic to address.  Given AI is a transformational platform, the need for an AI champion and well thought through org design is a critical success factor for a company.  I thought the videos and articles were well designed/selected.  The only challenge i had was with the diversity article which was more about AI's role in improving diverse hiring - vs. the need for diverse skills to develop an AI strategy.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Here are improvement areas that i noted during my review:  -\tVideo #1: can we call out the geographical/country differences in regulations and ensure that the legal team is knowledgeable about these differences and requirements -\tFor the Qs in #2 \u2013 can we ask as the 1st Question: How do you see your company organizing to develop an AI mindset given the recommendations in the article? -\tVideo (transform #3): 1:40 \u2013 this is really good material! I would just reinforce that to demystify AI they should treat it similar to deploying a large IT program \u2013 communicate early, often, and over multiple channels (e.g., partyrock, town halls, intranet, videos, posters) and use ADKAR certified change specialists to design these programs to maximize their effect. -\tVideo (transform #5): there isn\u2019t any text for the narrative similar to the other videos just white screen next to the speaker. I think when he speaks to the cross functional teams \u2013 he spoke about CM, Tech and legal but should have also said functional expertise to then also match with the IBM HR example.  What about recommendations on outside vendors that can bring in AI development, industry best practices, change mgmt experts? -\tDiscussion 2: Inclusive AI Teams article. My read of this article was that it focuses on AI to take bias out of hiring to create a diverse team.  I would recommend looking for an article that focuses more on the topic of the prior video \u2013 how implementing AI requires a diverse team of talents.  This would then provide greater detail on the roles and responsibilities, skill sets and even an example or two of these teams in action.",
    "is_show_stopper": true,
    "show_stopper_details": "just b/c the text didnt show up on the one video and the article could be one of two instead of the only article supporting the need for diversity in skills to design a good AI program.",

    "positive_comments": "Crafting an AI Enterprise Strategy will be top of mind for the students and likely they will want to learn about good/proven approaches to develop their own strategy.  I think the module provides excellent examples of the magnitude of strategic impact that AI can have for companies.  The customer examples are excellent and build the call to action for this module.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Where i thought this module missed the mark was in describing the \"how\" - how to design an enterprise AI strategy.  I was waiting for a framework or programmatic approach to be able to replicate the successes  described in the success stories.   My detailed notes from the module were:   -\tArticle (value #2 of 11): for the article, I was thinking this could be one of a set of 2 articles.  I would like to see an article more focused on concepts/recommendations on how to organize to develop a company AI strategy. This would include a framework or set of criteria to consider (like ethics being one of the overall set of pillars). -\tVideo #2: focuses on aligning AI opportunities with Business Goals.  This video has excellent case studies (e.g., PayPal) and does a great job demonstrating how AI is reinventing the company\u2019s services and service levels (business goals).  However, the video doesn\u2019t shed any light on \u201cHOW\u201d they aligned AI with their business strategy? -\tVideo#3 (value 5 of ll): This video as well does a great job on customer examples (e.g., MSFT) but I think we want to give them some tips/tools on how they can ID alignment and deliver results.  Can we add a framework or a simple process to ID their own AI strategies? -\tFor the Qs on Value 6 \u201cCultivating a culture of AI); I like the article and how it lays out the 11 ways AI improved EX.  Could we make the Q more specific \u2013 maybe something like of the 11 ways outlined in the article, what are the top 3 for your organization and why? -\tFor the video#4 (value 7): Again this has excellent examples/case studies. Could we add something to the video related to how to develop an AI strategy that leads to market leadership?  Are there some best practices that we can highlight about starting a journey to leadership and then tracking in phases over time?   Should we dive into the concepts of Agile development and how that provides flexibility but you\u2019ll also want to set periodic targets to ensure you\u2019re building toward market leadership?",
