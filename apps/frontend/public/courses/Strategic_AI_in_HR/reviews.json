    "improvement_opportunities": "While the module provided valuable information that HR professionals can utilize in their day-to-day functions, the delivery of the information could have been less dry and matter of fact, and more engaging. I am a big believer in \"gamification\" of information - I truly think that learning doesn't have to be boring and dry. In fact, the more engaging and fun learning is, the more likely it is to be impactful and memorable for learners.",

Again, the information and content were pretty clear and easy to understand.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Where this module fell a little short was its failure to clearly draw lines to illustrate the \"why\". The speaker made sweeping statements on what AI can do without giving clear illustrations or explanations in several instances. For example, on the statement that AI can \"improve employee engagement\" through \"employee sentiment analysis,\" which isn't explained.",
