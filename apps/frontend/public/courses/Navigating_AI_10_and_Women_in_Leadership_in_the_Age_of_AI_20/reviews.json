    "improvement_opportunities": "I've learned about different personality assessment tool, and how using them to set up a well rounded team can be an asset to a project or a team. It might be nice to take a look at some of these tools, as they do deal with emotions. There are good studies on them helping in a company, with bias. One that stands out is BANK.",
