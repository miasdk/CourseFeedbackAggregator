    "improvement_opportunities": "Note: my comments are made without knowing if there is any pre-work or other required courses, or what would be delivered by an instructor (if that's applicable) - unless there's another primer before this course, I'd suggest having an AI primer Module first. Module 1 jumps into use cases, financial metrics, and such for AI within a business, before giving the baseline of AI and how it broadly can impact business.  - 3rd video - the title is, \"How Generative AI is Shaping Competitor Landscapes\" but the video header and content is \"Building Stakeholder & Investor Confidence\". These seem to be a mismatch - Intro 8 of 11 - Article. This article requires a paid subscription  Overall - Module one seems focused on building support within a company for AI transformation. While critically important, I feel like there should be an AI primer first.  Module 2 gives a baseline on AI and then talks about use cases. Module 1 seems to focus on generating internal support for AI transformation and Module 3 focuses on how AI can grow the valuation of companies. I would argue the sequencing should be Modules 2, 3, then 1...or 2, 1, then 3.",

    "show_stopper_details": "I'm struggling with the flow of the modules. The content is amazing, but it seems to start with how to generate support inside a company for AI transformation, instead of an AI primer and a foundation of use cases. I'd even suggest that making the case for how AI drives increased business valuation may belong before how to generate support inside a company for AI transformation.  Note - I don't know if there are pre-requisites for this course that would address some of my concerns.",

    "improvement_opportunities": "I'll write this summary of feedback for 2, 3, and 4. I've taken extensive notes and can share if interested. - I appreciate the articles and they're very informative, but it seems a number of them cover the saame ground and the discussion questions seem very similar. I'm wondering if the students will be able to generate the ideas of how to change processes within their companies without detailed guidance. (Again, maybe the instructor will lead this or maybe the students already have the experience to innovate in this area)  - 1st video module 3 didn't have any visuals other than the speaker - 1st article module 3, I didn't see a real link between the article and ethical considerations. The article had terrific use cases - Module 4 is informative, but I'm confused why quantum computing is put as module 4. Quantum seems to be at least a decade aways and while it's important to get ahead of that, it doesn't seem practical to workshop ideas for something that very few company's have clear use cases for in today's market (meaning use cases that have been implemented). I would put this at the end as a look towards the future.  Overall - the course is impressive and I'm not an AI expert, but the flow confuses me. I would have the primer and use cases first, and organize around a concept of the why, the what, and the how. In some of the discussion questions is seems to assume the students know how to do certain things, like ideate on ways to change the business with AI before going in detail on industry use cases.   Thanks for the chance to review. The course is impressive and happy to share more feedback.",
