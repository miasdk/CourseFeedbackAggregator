Intro 8 of 11 - article referenced is behind a paywall and unaccessible.  Also, perhaps including a video option of 1080P instead of 700, as the clarity on iMac systems is noticeable.",

    "positive_comments": "The first lecture is very clear and relevant.  The speaker effectively uses case studies to illustrate the impact of making data driven decisions.  The linked article \"Top 7 AI Challenges & Solutions in 2024\" is great!  This is very relevant in the industry now and will provide students with some great insights.  Although I made several suggestions for improvements below, I thought that Lecture #3 \"How to Navigate the Challenges of AI Implementation\" had some great content.  Each challenge was described in the right level of detail and the messaging was very clear.  The linked article \"Adaptive Leadership vs A.I.\" was very thought provoking.  It will be a great prompt for a group discussion.  Lecture #4 is very well done and one of the better lectures in the course that I have reviewed.  The messaging about needing to commit to learning to effectively lead through change was clear and compelling.  Both the Unilever and Microsoft case studies were relevant and contained enough detail for students to take away valuable learnings.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "In the first lecture at 1:30, the visuals are out of sync with the talk track.  In Lecture #2 the InnovateTech case study is too high level.  While the speaker explained the company's initiative to drive innovation, it lacked any detail about how this was implemented or details about the benefits.   Also at 2:19, there is a typo in the visual: \"...projects.wing\"  The visionary.AI case study is also very vague.  The speaker states that they are \"continuously updating and improving their technology...\"  How is this different from any other software company?  I'd like to hear more detail about what makes them different.  In Lecture #3 there is a typo in the visual at 1:06--text says \"over estimated\", it should read \"under estimated\".   In Lecture #3 at 2:49, the speaker is discussing data integrity and quality and then cites encryption and anonymization as mitigations.  This is mixing the issues of data integrity and data security, which are completely different.  In Lecture #3 the visuals are overlapping starting at 3:12. (see Screenshot)",

    "positive_comments": "Lecture #1 was on point.  The speaker covered the topic in a way that was easy to understand and effectively used real life examples.   The linked article for Discussion is a relevant choice.  It provides students with an overview of ethical consideration when utilizing AI.  Lecture #2 is very relevant.  Aside from a few suggestions around wording below, the message is great.  I like the way the presenter discussed the need to balance compliance with existing regulations and being proactive to future risks.   This is great lesson for leaders that are looking to leverage AI in their business.  Lecture #3 is also on point.  Bias and hallucinations are two of the largest obstacles in deploying Gen AI--the lecture addresses both in a way that is easy to understand.  The case studies in Lecture #4 are relevant and support the points made throughout the module.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "I suggest rewording the description of Section 3. \"...particularly concerning concerns like the potential misuse for deepfakes\" sounds confusing.  In Lecture #2 at 0:40 the speaker says \"However, it's still too easy to overlook the link between older compliance issues like financial standards and reporting.\"  It sounds like part of this was edited and cut out of the talk track--the statement is confusing.  Also at 2:25, the visuals are not in sync with the presenter.  In Lecture #3, the speaker makes a error that needs to be edited at 1:20 and again at 3:23.  I would consider rewording the statement at 3:07 \"Hallucinations are an ethical problem because they can cause users to misunderstand the truth.\"     For section 6, which contains the linked article: The Digital World: Shaping global standards for Artificial Intelligence.   ISO/IEC 42001 ISO/IEC DIS 42001 was published in December--the article refers to it as a work in progress,  We should change the description to address this.  In Lecture#4 at 1:22 and again at 1:55, the visual is out of sync with the speaker.    The quiz was not available for me to take.  Altogether, this was a very comprehensive module that addressed many relevant factors of the ethics of using AI.  I think a sentence or two on what causes LLMs hallucinate would help students' understanding of the problem even more.",

It's one of the best lectures in the course.  The linked article \"Future-ready your people for an AI workplace\" is thought provoking and relevant.  Lecture #2 is also very well done.  Change management is a barrier to success in any technology deployment and it is even more challenging with disruptive technologies like Generative AI.  I really like the suggestion of using PartyRock to introduce people to Generative AI.  We could even add a link to PartyRock or some of the PartyRock apps to make this even better.  The linked article \"Empowering Diversity and Inclusion: The Role of AI in Building an Inclusive Workplace\" is a good addition to the module.  We have used AI to detect biases in job descriptions and found it to be very effective.  The linked article: \"Communicating Your AI Initiatives: Benefits and Risks\" is very relevant to the content in the module/.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "In Lecture#2 there is missing text in the visual at 3:03.  Lecture#3 is missing visuals from 0:18 until the conclusion. (see Screenshot 4) The two case studies used in this lecture are both healthcare related, and very similar.  At :59 in Lecture #4, the speaker states \"...a Marketing team can utilize generative AI algorithms to create personalized and engaging content or analyze customer behaviors.\"  While generative AI can produce content, it's not apparent to me how it would be used to analyze behavior.  It could summarize a series of analyses produced elsewhere, but I believe other technologies would be performing the analysis.  I was unable to attempt the quiz.",

    "positive_comments": "The video instructors are very professional and easy to understand.  If the student audience will come in with a basic tech background, the speed and flow of content is excellent.     I thought your intro video trying to simplify the description of how Quantum works vs. traditional 'bits' was excellent.  i like the metaphor of a light switch.  what about using the dimmer switch as an example of quantum? The structure of the course is excellent - the mix of video, articles and 'homework' flows nicely for the student.  The focus on investing in the workforce now is an important one and the module does an excellent job through the article and video to discuss that.  The discussion of workforce impact also is good in the sense that the course focuses AI not on just being an IT challenge but a business challenge.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Could we add a timeline or timeline plus expected future timeline of Quantum computing? Also, it would be great to show a comparative chart of the performance delta b/w traditional computing and Quantum to give a visual of the massive performance improvement of this technology. I think there is an opportunity to close the gap b/w the video and the workforce linkedin article.  In the prior modules you cover the potential industry impact of AI so you could swap that out or shorten that to make room for a discussion of the potential change in roles and responsibilities for Data analytics teams that then sets up the article. Is there a possibility to discuss the current data analytics roles and then say - invest now in 1 resource as the frontier resource to experiment with AI and with the direction to have the team eventually become AI centric as part of a series of steps as the technology matures?    For students that come in with little or no background on AI, i wonder if having a terms/glossary would be helpful? If that's somewhere in the course already then forgive me...  For the customer experience assignment, it may be helpful to include an article before it discussing or providing examples from the customer lens.  How will patients be able to improve their engagement with the provider through AI.  That may stimulate new ideas from the students when they do their assignment. (nice to have)  For the workforce discussion, it would be great to discuss how the advent of AI will transform the role of data science within a company and the future impact of those in other functional groups - marketing, sales, product development...  That may be the focus of module 6 so i'll revisit when i get there.  In section 8, the first Q \"How can insights into quantum computing and regulatory compliance be strategically applied to enhance your business operations while ensuring compliance and ethical use?\" - I'd like to see how the students respond more to the ethical challenges they see for their industry or company.  Can we start with that more direct question and then dive into the implications?  I also think it might be helpful to have another article to support this topic.  Perhaps one that discusses more potential examples of ethical or moral challenges AI could present?  I see module 5 goes deeper into this topic so maybe its not needed here?  Another idea, is there a way to show an illustration or framework of where AI will set within a generic tech infrastructure stack? Just to show how GenAI systems may sit in parallel to legacy systems, may interact with key data sets, etc.  I think that may help to give the student a visual of how AI will be integrated into existing structures. If that's too IT-centric then i understand.",
