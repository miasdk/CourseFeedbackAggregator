    "positive_comments": "I thoroughly appreciated Module 1: Introduction to Customer Experience and its approach, particularly its commencement with a comprehensive presentation on the customer experience. Furthermore, I found the customer experience assignments and ensuing discussions to be highly engaging. For example, in assignment #3, which encouraged students to describe their experiences using five  adjectives: \"shifty,\" \"unlovable,\" \"clumsy,\" \"knotted,\" and \"slow.\" These assignments, coupled with the discussions, facilitated an exploration of diverse perspectives on customer experiences in various companies. For instance, the first discussion in module 1, revolved around students' personal lessons and experiences from their respective companies, which seamlessly transitioned into an enlightening dialogue on the broader topic of lessons gleaned from customer experiences. I consider this aspect particularly valuable in comprehending the varied approaches adopted by companies in the realm of customer experience management.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "One improvement that I would propose pertains to the commencement of the capstone project, specifically in the formulation of the problem statement. Some students may think they have to mention the name of the company they work for. It is imperative to acknowledge that certain students may encounter constraints when divulging details about the companies they are currently employed by. Therefore, I would recommend introducing the option for students to utilize a hypothetical entity, such as the \"XYZ Company,\" as an alternative reference. This approach would enable students to contribute authentic information to their capstone projects without the necessity of disclosing confidential company affiliations. Consequently, this adaptation would foster a more immersive and secure engagement with the capstone project, mitigating concerns and facilitating a seamless learning experience.",
