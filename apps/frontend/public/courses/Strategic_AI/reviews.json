    "positive_comments": "AI is such a new and evolving field of study, it is a great start to provide this course. The structure of the course with video of 5-6 minutes is very effective. The addition of podcasts by Benard Marr were well placed. The article was helpful. The chapter of ROI is essential. As companies roll out different AI tools, many keep saying a ROI will appear overtime. Usually withing the first quarter, you will be able to determine whether or not the tool is useful overtime. You may even be able to ask chatgpt for example. The proposed question of \"Can We Trust Artificial Intelligence?\" by Caltech was a nice addition for deeper analysis that can be applied to ethics. The module opens as a great overview or AI and proposes questions for more study and individual business implementation.",
    "improvement_opportunities": "Overall, it looks like the videos and articles are dated in 2022. The business world of AI has moved with rapid speed. You may want to consider more updated videos and materials. In the future, I am assuming the instructor in this course is an AI. Maybe, you can add choices of AI instructors and voices.  Because this is module 1,I'm sure the course evolves in updates.",

It provokes more questions and study in programming or the coding. There appeared many introductions for items for more study with (CNN).  The focus on customers was valuable. The real world business examples such as in education and retailers gives a broad perspective. The focus on FOX using AI with the audience and customers gives a mediated prospect to incorporate in social mediated business models.  There were better articles and videos to implement specific to business use and to add value to customers.  Overall. this was a great module focused on practical use in audience and customers. the capstone will provide students with a action plan in their businesses.",

The glossary and the transcript at the beginning of the modules is a great idea. As I went through the model I would start to formulate questions and then the next section would answer them!  The short video clips were helpful to absorb information.  There is so much information that it\u2019s a lot to digest so the format and useful resources added at the end were also helpful.  Lots of strong takeaways!",
    "improvement_opportunities": "I\u2019m curious who the specific audience will be for the course and how it will be listed ie Business, IT, etc?   The reason I ask I am a long term Finance & Strategy leader, so as I look at the case study and my role in an organization, I would be involved in the decisions and strategy across business functions.  So it\u2019s very relevant to my role and easy to follow and apply the case study.  But I wonder for new managers in an organization would the case study become very overwhelming for them?  They would likely need to interact with other business functions to understand the implementation, need and use side.  (My opinion). In my opinion this module is very useful for Senior Executives and Board Directors.",

What will the best practices to be implemented by industry? The section that discusses up skilling of employees - are there any case studies with Amazon or others that could be included that demonstrate the before and after for some of these roles?  It would be helpful to have this to better understand some of the employee development needs. A small tech note - some of the articles take a very long time to open or get stuck so I would have to exit the section and go back a few times for it to come up.  I work on an IPad which my be part of the issue but thought I would mention.",

I was kept engaged watching the videos as there were packed with powerful content and able to be viewed in bite-sized pieces and interspersed with discussions, articles and discussions. The downloads and resources were very helpful as well.  Understanding how AI is used in so many different industries and what positions were at risk was very interesting and eye-opening.

The information on the GE slide was reversed with the information on the BofA slide.",
